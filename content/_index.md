The aim of the seminar is to bring together young researchers in computational statistic (statistics, methodology, econometrics, computer science, machine learning). The seminar will start in spring 2025 and is co-organized by [Nuria Senar Villadeamigo](https://github.com/nuria-sv) and [Kayan√© Robach](https://kayanerobach.github.io/).

We plan to organize 4 events per year, where each event consist of two scientific talks and a networking events with some drinks afterwards.
