The seminar series aims to bring together young researchers in computational statistics (including statistics, methodology, econometrics, computer science, and machine learning) to explore the evolution of statistical and computational methods.

Starting in spring 2025, the series will feature interactive events where a speaker discuss the development of a popular method, from its basics to current innovations. Participants will engage in brainstorming sessions and collaborative problem solving, diving into both theoretical and practical frameworks. Some drinks will follow afterwards.

The seminar is co-organized by [Nuria Senar](https://github.com/nuria-sv) and [Kayan√© Robach](https://kayanerobach.github.io/).
