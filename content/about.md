The aim of the seminar is to bring together researchers in causal inference from the VU, UvA, Amsterdam UMC and CWI, but the seminar is open to everyone. The seminar started in 2023 and is co-organized by [Sara Magliacane](https://saramagliacane.github.io/), [Joris Mooij](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.m.mooij/) and [St√©phanie van der Pas](https://www.stephanievanderpas.nl/).

We plan to organize 4 events per year, where each event consist of two scientific talks and a networking events with some drinks afterwards.
